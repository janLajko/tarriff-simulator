INFO:sectionieepa_agent:note(2)(j) For the purposes of heading 9903.01.10, products of Canada, other than products described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, 9903.01.13, 9903.01.14, 9903.01.15, 9903.01.16, 9903.76.01, 9903.76.02 and 9903.76.03 and other than products for personal use included in accompanied baggage of persons arriving in the United States, shall be subject to an additional 35% ad valorem rate of duty. For the purposes of heading 9903.01.13, the covered products of Canada shall be subject to an additional 10% ad valorem rate of duty. Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to this subchapter, all products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by headings 9903.01.10 and 9903.01.13 shall also be subject to the general rates of duty imposed on products of Canada entered under subheadings in chapters 1 to 97 of the tariff schedule. The additional duties imposed by headings 9903.01.10 and 9903.01.13 that apply to products of Canada include both goods of Canada under the rules set forth in part 102, title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable, as well as goods for which Canada was the last country of substantial transformation prior to importation into the United States. Products of Canada that are eligible for special tariff treatment under general note 3(c)(i) to the tariff schedule, or that are eligible for temporary duty exemptions or reductions under subchapter II to chapter 99, shall be subject tothe additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by headings 9903.01.10 and 9903.01.13. The additional duties imposed by headings 9903.01.10 and 9903.01.13 shall not apply to goods for which entry is properly claimed under a provision of chapter 98 of the tariff schedule pursuant to applicable regulations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"), and whenever CBP agrees that entry under such a provision is appropriate, except for goods entered under heading 9802.00.80; and subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60. For subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, the additional duties apply to the value of repairs, alterations, or processing performed (in Canada), as described in the applicable subheading. For heading 9802.00.80, the additional duties apply to the value of the article assembled abroad (in Canada), less the cost or value of such products of the United States, as described. Products of Canada that are provided for in headings 9903.01.10 or 9903.01.13 shall continue to be subject to antidumping, countervailing, or other duties, taxes, fees, exactions and charges that apply to such products, as well as to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by headings 9903.01.10 and 9903.01.13. Products of Canada that are provided for in headings 9903.01.10 and 9903.01.13 and that are otherwise eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) - known as " de minimis " exemption - may continue to qualify for the exemption, but the de minimis exemption shall cease to be available for such articles upon notification by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to the President that adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue applicable for covered articles otherwise eligible for de minimis exemption.
INFO:sectionieepa_agent:Querying LLM for notes note(2)(j)
INFO:sectionieepa_agent:message:You are a structured extractor for HTSUS Section ieepa notes.
Output JSON only. No inference. No paraphrasing. Include only codes that are explicitly printed in the input text.

Objective:
From the input legal note text, produce three outputs:
1. **input_htscode** – copy exactly from `context.input_htscode` (a list provided by the caller). Do NOT infer, paraphrase, or add/remove codes. If this field is missing, return an empty list.
2. **scope** – headings or subheadings that are explicitly stated to be covered (inside the range) by the measure. Do **not** include anything that appears only inside "except"/"exclusion" phrasing.
3. **except** – headings or subheadings explicitly excluded (phrases such as "except … provided for in …").

Each object in scope or except must match the `sieepa_scope` table schema:

- keys                 // comma-separated exact heading or HTS8 codes (e.g. "0203.29.20,0203.29.40,0206.10.00") when conditions are identical
- key                  // single exact heading or HTS8 code (e.g. "9903.88.05" or "8501.10.40") when used alone
- key_type             // one of: "heading" (use for 4-digit headings and any 6-digit references), "hts8" (8-digit subheading), "hts10" (10-digit statistical reporting number)
- country_iso2         // ISO-2 country code mentioned in the text (e.g. "UK"), else null
- source_label         // e.g. "note20(a)" or "note20(b)-exclusion"
- effective_start_date // ISO date; use context.fallback_start_date if not stated
- effective_end_date   // ISO date or null

Extraction rules:
A. Set **input_htscode** equal to `context.input_htscode`. Never invent or summarize values.

B. Identify all **scope** items:
   - Include every HTS reference that is explicitly printed (4-digit headings, 6-digit subheadings, 8-digit HTS codes, or 10-digit statistical reporting numbers) under "applies to…" or similar language.
   - When the text prints a range such as "9903.02.74-9903.02.77" or "9903.02.74–9903.02.77", expand it into each discrete heading (9903.02.74, 9903.02.75, 9903.02.76, 9903.02.77).
   - Do NOT include `input_htscode` again.
   - **When multiple HTS codes share identical conditions (same key_type, country_iso2, source_label, effective_start_date, effective_end_date), combine them using "keys" field with comma-separated values instead of creating separate objects.**

C. Identify all **except** items:
   - Look for any statement that exempts certain products/headings from the additional duties that would otherwise apply to `input_htscode`.
   - Common patterns include:
     * "Except as provided in heading(s) X..."
     * "The additional duties imposed by heading(s) [including input_htscode] shall not apply to [products] provided for in heading(s) X"
     * "As provided in heading X, the additional duties... shall not apply to products classified in..."
   
   - **Understanding Full vs Partial Exemptions:**
     * **FULL EXEMPTION** (add to `except`): The products classified in the referenced heading are COMPLETELY exempt from the additional duties.
       - The entire product/article in that heading is not subject to the additional duties.
       - Example: "The additional duties shall not apply to medium- and heavy-duty vehicle parts provided for in headings 9903.74.08 and 9903.74.09"
         → Products in 9903.74.08 and 9903.74.09 are FULLY exempt
     
     * **PARTIAL EXEMPTION** (do NOT add to `except`): Only a specific portion/component of the products in the referenced heading is exempt, while the remaining portion is still subject to duties.
       - The text clarifies that duties still apply to some part/content of the product.
       - Example: "The additional duties shall not apply to products of iron or steel provided for in headings 9903.81.87 and 9903.81.88, but such additional duties shall apply to the non-steel content of such products"
         → Products in 9903.81.87 and 9903.81.88 are only PARTIALLY exempt (steel content exempt, non-steel content still taxed)
       - Example: "The additional duties shall not apply to the declared value of the steel content of the derivative iron or steel products provided for in headings 9903.81.89-9903.81.93, but shall apply to the non-steel content"
         → Products in 9903.81.89-9903.81.93 are only PARTIALLY exempt
   
   - **Decision Rule**: 
     * Use your understanding of the legal language to determine: Are the products in the referenced heading COMPLETELY exempt from the additional duties, or are they only PARTIALLY exempt?
     * Only add headings to `except` if they represent FULL exemptions.
     * Do NOT add headings that represent partial exemptions (where some portion is still taxable).

   - Special handling for clauses like "As provided for in heading 9903.01.32, the additional duties imposed by headings 9903.01.25, 9903.01.35, 9903.01.39, 9903.01.63, and 9903.02.01-9903.02.73 shall not apply to products classified in the following subheadings …": the listed subheadings (e.g., 0201.10.05, 0201.10.10) are the contents of heading 9903.01.32. Add **9903.01.32** itself to the `except` set for each imposing heading (9903.01.25, 9903.01.35, 9903.01.39, 9903.01.63, 9903.02.01-9903.02.73). Do not add the enumerated subheadings directly to `except` in this scenario.
   
   - **Checking Applicability**: 
     * For an exemption to apply to `input_htscode`, the text must indicate that the exemption applies to the additional duties imposed by a list of headings that includes `input_htscode`.
     * Ranges like "9903.02.01-9903.02.73" include ALL codes numerically between start and end (inclusive).
     * Example: If input_htscode is "9903.02.02" and text says "duties imposed by headings 9903.02.01-9903.02.73 shall not apply to X", then X is an exemption for 9903.02.02.
   
   - Mark their source_label with "-exclusion".
   - Apply the same combination rule as scope items when conditions are identical.

D. Ignore carve-outs that clearly belong to other headings/programs (e.g., "As provided in 9903.01.26 ... products of Canada"). Unless the sentence explicitly ties the relief to `input_htscode`, do not add those references to `scope` or `except`.

E. Set country_iso2 to the ISO-2 code for the country named in the text (e.g. "UK" for "products of the United Kingdom"). If no country is mentioned, leave it null.

F. Only populate effective_start_date and effective_end_date when explicit "effective" or date ranges appear in the text.  
   - Example: "effective January 1, 2023" → effective_start_date = "2023-01-01"  
   - Example: "effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019" → effective_start_date = "2019-01-01", effective_end_date = "2019-12-31"  
   - Entry/admission timing clauses (e.g., goods admitted to a foreign trade zone before 12:01 a.m. EDT on March 12, 2025) do **not** impose an effective_end_date; they only describe which entries qualify.  
   - If no explicit "effective" or date reference appears, leave both fields null. Do not use fallback_start_date.

G. Remove duplicates.

H. When multiple note blocks are provided, use `context.note_labels` (same order as the input blocks) for their labels. `context.primary_note_labels` lists the notes that actually triggered this extraction. `context.supporting_note_labels` lists subdivisions that were included only because a primary note referenced them (e.g., "subdivision (l)"). For supporting notes:
   - Treat any HTS codes printed inside those blocks as exclusions for the referencing primary note unless the supporting block clearly introduces a different heading of its own.
   - Use the primary note label with "-exclusion" for the `source_label` (e.g., `note16(m)-exclusion`).
   - Do NOT add supporting-block codes to the scope of the current heading unless the text explicitly says they apply to that heading.

I. If a supporting block explicitly states a different heading (e.g., "The rates … in heading 9903.81.89"), you may output its own scope entries but keep the source_label equal to that supporting note label.

Context (provided by caller):
// context.input_htscode → base headings provided by the caller; copy directly into "input_htscode"
// context.note_labels → labels for each input block (in order)
// context.primary_note_labels → subset that actually triggered extraction
// context.supporting_note_labels → subdivisions referenced only to describe exclusions for the primaries

   - Apply the same combination rule as scope items when conditions are identical.

D. Ignore carve-outs that clearly belong to other headings/programs (e.g., "As provided in 9903.01.26 ... products of Canada"). Unless the sentence explicitly ties the relief to `input_htscode`, do not add those references to `scope` or `except`.

E. Set country_iso2 to the ISO-2 code for the country named in the text (e.g. "UK" for "products of the United Kingdom"). If no country is mentioned, leave it null.

F. Only populate effective_start_date and effective_end_date when explicit "effective" or date ranges appear in the text.  
   - Example: "effective January 1, 2023" → effective_start_date = "2023-01-01"  
   - Example: "effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019" → effective_start_date = "2019-01-01", effective_end_date = "2019-12-31"  
   - Entry/admission timing clauses (e.g., goods admitted to a foreign trade zone before 12:01 a.m. EDT on March 12, 2025) do **not** impose an effective_end_date; they only describe which entries qualify.  
   - If no explicit "effective" or date reference appears, leave both fields null. Do not use fallback_start_date.

G. Remove duplicates.

H. When multiple note blocks are provided, use `context.note_labels` (same order as the input blocks) for their labels. `context.primary_note_labels` lists the notes that actually triggered this extraction. `context.supporting_note_labels` lists subdivisions that were included only because a primary note referenced them (e.g., "subdivision (l)"). For supporting notes:
   - Treat any HTS codes printed inside those blocks as exclusions for the referencing primary note unless the supporting block clearly introduces a different heading of its own.
   - Use the primary note label with "-exclusion" for the `source_label` (e.g., `note16(m)-exclusion`).
   - Do NOT add supporting-block codes to the scope of the current heading unless the text explicitly says they apply to that heading.

I. If a supporting block explicitly states a different heading (e.g., "The rates … in heading 9903.81.89"), you may output its own scope entries but keep the source_label equal to that supporting note label.

Heading 9903.01.16 does not apply to products described in headings 9903.01.11, 9903.01.12, 9903.01.14, 9903.76.01, 9903.76.02 and 9903.76.03, or products for personal use included in accompanied baggage of persons arriving in the United States. Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to this subchapter, all products of Canada that are subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall also be subject to the general rates of duty imposed on products of Canada entered under subheadings in chapters 1 to 97 of the tariff schedule. The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 apply to products of Canada including both goods of Canada under the rules set forth in part 102, title 19 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable, as well as goods for which Canada was the last country of substantial transformation prior to importation into the United States. Products of Canada that are eligible for temporary duty exemptions or reductions under subchapter II to chapter 99, shall be subject to the additional ad valorem rate of duty imposed by heading 9903.01.16. The additional duties imposed by heading 9903.01.16 shall not apply to goods for which entry is properly claimed under a provision of chapter 98 of the tariff schedule pursuant to applicable regulations of CBP, and whenever CBP agrees that entry under such a provision is appropriate, except for goods entered under heading 9802.00.80; and subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60. For subheadings 9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, the additional duties apply to the value of repairs, alterations, or processing performed (in Canada), as described in the applicable subheading. For heading 9802.00.80, the additional duties apply to the value of the article assembled abroad (in Canada), less the cost or value of such products of the United States, as described. Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 shall continue to be subject to antidumping, countervailing, or other duties, taxes, fees, exactions and charges that apply to such products. Products of Canada that are provided for in heading 9903.01.16 that are otherwise eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) ? known as the ?de minimis? exemption ? may continue to qualify for the exemption, but the de minimis exemption shall cease to be available for such articles upon notification by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to the President that adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue applicable for covered articles otherwise eligible for the de minimis exemption.
INFO:sectionieepa_agent:Querying LLM for notes note(2)(m)
INFO:sectionieepa_agent:message:You are a structured extractor for HTSUS Section ieepa notes.
Output JSON only. No inference. No paraphrasing. Include only codes that are explicitly printed in the input text.

Objective:
From the input legal note text, produce three outputs:
1. **input_htscode** – copy exactly from `context.input_htscode` (a list provided by the caller). Do NOT infer, paraphrase, or add/remove codes. If this field is missing, return an empty list.
2. **scope** – headings or subheadings that are explicitly stated to be covered (inside the range) by the measure. Do **not** include anything that appears only inside "except"/"exclusion" phrasing.
3. **except** – headings or subheadings explicitly excluded (phrases such as "except … provided for in …").

Each object in scope or except must match the `sieepa_scope` table schema:

- keys                 // comma-separated exact heading or HTS8 codes (e.g. "0203.29.20,0203.29.40,0206.10.00") when conditions are identical
- key                  // single exact heading or HTS8 code (e.g. "9903.88.05" or "8501.10.40") when used alone
- key_type             // one of: "heading" (use for 4-digit headings and any 6-digit references), "hts8" (8-digit subheading), "hts10" (10-digit statistical reporting number)
- country_iso2         // ISO-2 country code mentioned in the text (e.g. "UK"), else null
- source_label         // e.g. "note20(a)" or "note20(b)-exclusion"
- effective_start_date // ISO date; use context.fallback_start_date if not stated
- effective_end_date   // ISO date or null

Extraction rules:
A. Set **input_htscode** equal to `context.input_htscode`. Never invent or summarize values.

B. Identify all **scope** items:
   - Include every HTS reference that is explicitly printed (4-digit headings, 6-digit subheadings, 8-digit HTS codes, or 10-digit statistical reporting numbers) under "applies to…" or similar language.
   - When the text prints a range such as "9903.02.74-9903.02.77" or "9903.02.74–9903.02.77", expand it into each discrete heading (9903.02.74, 9903.02.75, 9903.02.76, 9903.02.77).
   - Do NOT include `input_htscode` again.
   - **When multiple HTS codes share identical conditions (same key_type, country_iso2, source_label, effective_start_date, effective_end_date), combine them using "keys" field with comma-separated values instead of creating separate objects.**

C. Identify all **except** items:
   - Look for any statement that exempts certain products/headings from the additional duties that would otherwise apply to `input_htscode`.
   - Common patterns include:
     * "Except as provided in heading(s) X..."
     * "The additional duties imposed by heading(s) [including input_htscode] shall not apply to [products] provided for in heading(s) X"
     * "As provided in heading X, the additional duties... shall not apply to products classified in..."
   
   - **Understanding Full vs Partial Exemptions:**
     * **FULL EXEMPTION** (add to `except`): The products classified in the referenced heading are COMPLETELY exempt from the additional duties.
       - The entire product/article in that heading is not subject to the additional duties.
       - Example: "The additional duties shall not apply to medium- and heavy-duty vehicle parts provided for in headings 9903.74.08 and 9903.74.09"
         → Products in 9903.74.08 and 9903.74.09 are FULLY exempt
     
     * **PARTIAL EXEMPTION** (do NOT add to `except`): Only a specific portion/component of the products in the referenced heading is exempt, while the remaining portion is still subject to duties.
       - The text clarifies that duties still apply to some part/content of the product.
       - Example: "The additional duties shall not apply to products of iron or steel provided for in headings 9903.81.87 and 9903.81.88, but such additional duties shall apply to the non-steel content of such products"
         → Products in 9903.81.87 and 9903.81.88 are only PARTIALLY exempt (steel content exempt, non-steel content still taxed)
       - Example: "The additional duties shall not apply to the declared value of the steel content of the derivative iron or steel products provided for in headings 9903.81.89-9903.81.93, but shall apply to the non-steel content"
         → Products in 9903.81.89-9903.81.93 are only PARTIALLY exempt
   
   - **Decision Rule**: 
     * Use your understanding of the legal language to determine: Are the products in the referenced heading COMPLETELY exempt from the additional duties, or are they only PARTIALLY exempt?
     * Only add headings to `except` if they represent FULL exemptions.
     * Do NOT add headings that represent partial exemptions (where some portion is still taxable).

   - Special handling for clauses like "As provided for in heading 9903.01.32, the additional duties imposed by headings 9903.01.25, 9903.01.35, 9903.01.39, 9903.01.63, and 9903.02.01-9903.02.73 shall not apply to products classified in the following subheadings …": the listed subheadings (e.g., 0201.10.05, 0201.10.10) are the contents of heading 9903.01.32. Add **9903.01.32** itself to the `except` set for each imposing heading (9903.01.25, 9903.01.35, 9903.01.39, 9903.01.63, 9903.02.01-9903.02.73). Do not add the enumerated subheadings directly to `except` in this scenario.
   
   - **Checking Applicability**: 
     * For an exemption to apply to `input_htscode`, the text must indicate that the exemption applies to the additional duties imposed by a list of headings that includes `input_htscode`.
     * Ranges like "9903.02.01-9903.02.73" include ALL codes numerically between start and end (inclusive).
     * Example: If input_htscode is "9903.02.02" and text says "duties imposed by headings 9903.02.01-9903.02.73 shall not apply to X", then X is an exemption for 9903.02.02.
   
   - Mark their source_label with "-exclusion".
   - Apply the same combination rule as scope items when conditions are identical.

D. Ignore carve-outs that clearly belong to other headings/programs (e.g., "As provided in 9903.01.26 ... products of Canada"). Unless the sentence explicitly ties the relief to `input_htscode`, do not add those references to `scope` or `except`.

E. Set country_iso2 to the ISO-2 code for the country named in the text (e.g. "UK" for "products of the United Kingdom"). If no country is mentioned, leave it null.

F. Only populate effective_start_date and effective_end_date when explicit "effective" or date ranges appear in the text.  
   - Example: "effective January 1, 2023" → effective_start_date = "2023-01-01"  
   - Example: "effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019" → effective_start_date = "2019-01-01", effective_end_date = "2019-12-31"  
   - Entry/admission timing clauses (e.g., goods admitted to a foreign trade zone before 12:01 a.m. EDT on March 12, 2025) do **not** impose an effective_end_date; they only describe which entries qualify.  
   - If no explicit "effective" or date reference appears, leave both fields null. Do not use fallback_start_date.

G. Remove duplicates.

H. When multiple note blocks are provided, use `context.note_labels` (same order as the input blocks) for their labels. `context.primary_note_labels` lists the notes that actually triggered this extraction. `context.supporting_note_labels` lists subdivisions that were included only because a primary note referenced them (e.g., "subdivision (l)"). For supporting notes:
   - Treat any HTS codes printed inside those blocks as exclusions for the referencing primary note unless the supporting block clearly introduces a different heading of its own.
