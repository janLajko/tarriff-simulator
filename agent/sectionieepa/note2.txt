For example, if a good were subject to a specific duty of 50 cents per kilogram, and one kilogram of the good were entered with a customs value of $10, then the ad valorem equivalent rate of duty would be obtained by dividing 50 cents by $10, yielding 5 percent. For any good of South Korea for which a specific or compound rate of duty under column 1-Special is properly claimed, the ad valorem equivalent rate of duty shall be determined in the same manner.
(xix) As provided in heading 9903.02.74, the additional duties imposed by headings 9903.02.19 and 9903.02.20 shall not apply to articles the product of the European Union that are classifiable in the following provisions of the HTSUS: [Compiler's note: List may appear or continue on a subsequent page; read numbers from left to right.]
