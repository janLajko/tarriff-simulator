做一个关于HTS 301关税的aiagent
aiagent1（做数据预处理）：
1、从POSTGRE database获取(301)hts code信息
1、阅读hts code描述(例如9903.88.01  Except as provided in headings 9903.88.05, 9903.88.06, 9903.88.07, 9903.88.08, 9903.88.10, 9903.88.11, 9903.88.14, 9903.88.19, 9903.88.50, 9903.88.52, 9903.88.58, 9903.88.60, 9903.88.62, 9903.88.66, 9903.88.67, 9903.88.68, or 9903.88.69, articles the product of China, as provided for in U.S. note 20(a) to this subchapter and as provided for in the subheadings enumerated in U.S. note 20(b) [to this subchapter]))
2、LLM根据描述分成except和scope,except包含9903.88.05, 9903.88.06, 9903.88.07, 9903.88.08, 9903.88.10, 9903.88.11, 9903.88.14, 9903.88.19, 9903.88.50, 9903.88.52, 9903.88.58, 9903.88.60, 9903.88.62, 9903.88.66, 9903.88.67, 9903.88.68, or 9903.88.69，scope note 20(b)
3、分别对except和scope进行数据整理，得到9903.88.01的具体规则,例如 except提到的hts9903.88.05,note 20(b)分别处理hts和note的逻辑，note可以从数据库中获取，下面有example（note(20)(a),note(20)(b)）,根据note的信息整理出具体的规则
aiagent2：
1、实时分析CSMS,FEDRARGIGSTER网站
2、一条新闻对301有修改，更新301的具体数据
